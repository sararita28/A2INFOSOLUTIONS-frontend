          If you’ve ever been involved in the implementation of a new
          application you’ll know it can take months or even years to get it up
          and running. But with a cloud-based application you can cut through
          this complexity. In many cases you can sign up and start using the
          application instantly, and even the most wide-ranging enterprise
          applications are usually up and running in a matter of days or weeks
          rather than months or years.
